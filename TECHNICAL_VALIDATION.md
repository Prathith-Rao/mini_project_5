## 1️⃣ Core Mathematical Formulas

### A. Power Consumption Model

#### Nonlinear LED Power Model (Recommended)
```
P(b) = P_rated × (b/100)^α × (1 + η_loss)
```

Where:
- `P(b)` = Power consumption at brightness b (Watts)
- `P_rated` = Rated lamp power at 100% brightness (50-70W for LED streetlights)
- `b` = Brightness percentage (15-100%)
- `α` = Brightness exponent (1.0 - 1.25, typically 1.15 for LEDs)
- `η_loss` = Driver efficiency loss (3-5%, typically 4%)

**Implementation:** `/src/utils/powerModel.ts:calculatePowerConsumption()`

**Justification:** LEDs exhibit slight nonlinearity due to driver circuitry efficiency variations. α=1.15 reflects typical LED driver characteristics.

---

### B. Energy Calculations

#### Smart System Energy (per time interval)
```
E_smart(t) = Σ[i=1 to N] P(b_i) × Δt × N_lamps
```

Where:
- `E_smart` = Total energy consumed by smart system (Wh)
- `N` = Number of time intervals
- `P(b_i)` = Power at brightness level i
- `Δt` = Time interval duration (hours)
- `N_lamps` = Total number of streetlights

#### Traditional System Energy
```
E_trad(t) = Σ[i=1 to N] P_rated × (1 + η_loss) × Δt × N_lamps
```

#### Energy Saved
```
E_saved = E_trad - E_smart (in Wh or kWh)
```

#### Percentage Saved
```
% Saved = (E_saved / E_trad) × 100
```

**Implementation:** `/src/utils/calculations.ts:calculateEnergy()`

---

### C. Cost & Environmental Impact

#### Cost Savings
```
Cost_saved = E_saved_kWh × c
```
Where `c` = electricity cost per kWh (typically $0.10-0.15)

#### CO₂ Reduction
```
CO2_saved = E_saved_kWh × ε
```
Where `ε` = emission factor (0.4-0.5 kg CO₂/kWh, varies by region)

**Implementation:** Integrated in `calculateEnergy()`

---

### D. Cumulative Savings

```
CumSaved(t) = Σ[i=1 to t] (E_trad,i - E_smart,i)
```

For each hour h:
```
Cumulative_Energy_h = Σ[hour=1 to h] (E_trad,hour - E_smart,hour)
Cumulative_Cost_h = Cumulative_Energy_h × c
Cumulative_CO2_h = Cumulative_Energy_h × ε
```

**Implementation:** `/src/utils/calculations.ts:getCumulativeSavings()`

## 2️⃣ Machine Learning Model Validation

### A. XGBoost Prediction Model

#### Features Used
1. **Sunlight intensity** (0-100%): Primary inhibitor of brightness
2. **Traffic density** (0-100%): Demand driver during low-light periods
3. **Motion detection** (0/1): Binary indicator for pedestrian/vehicle presence
4. **Weather condition** (0=clear, 1=cloudy, 2=rainy): Visibility modifier
5. **Time of day** (hour, sin/cos encoded): Temporal patterns

#### Feature Engineering
```python
normalized_features = {
    sunlight: sunlight / 100,
    traffic: traffic / 100,
    motion: binary(0 or 1),
    weather: weather / 2,
    hour_sin: sin(2π × hour / 24),
    hour_cos: cos(2π × hour / 24)
}
```

**Implementation:** `/src/utils/mlModel.ts:trainAndPredictXGBoost()`

---

### B. Validation Metrics

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)
```
r = [n(ΣXY) - (ΣX)(ΣY)] / √[(nΣX² - (ΣX)²)(nΣY² - (ΣY)²)]
```
Where X = actual brightness, Y = predicted brightness

**Expected Range:** 0.85 - 0.95 (Good to Excellent)
**Current Implementation:** 0.90 - 0.93

#### Coefficient of Determination (R²)
```
R² = r²
```
**Interpretation:**
- R² ≥ 0.95: Excellent
- R² ≥ 0.85: Very Good
- R² ≥ 0.70: Good
- R² < 0.70: Needs improvement

#### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
```
RMSE = √[Σ(y_actual - y_pred)² / n]
```
**Expected Range:** 2-5% brightness units
**Lower is better**

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
```
MAE = Σ|y_actual - y_pred| / n
```
**Expected Range:** 1.5-4% brightness units

#### Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
```
MAPE = (100/n) × Σ|y_actual - y_pred| / |y_actual|
```

**Implementation:** `/src/utils/calculations.ts:calculateValidationMetrics()`

## 5️⃣ Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Current Limitations

1. **Synthetic Data**
   - **Issue:** Simulation uses generated data, not real sensors
   - **Mitigation:** Calibrate with pilot deployment data; use real traffic APIs
   - **Impact on validation:** Results are illustrative; real savings may vary ±10%

2. **Model Overfitting Risk**
   - **Issue:** High R² (0.90-0.93) may indicate overfitting to synthetic patterns
   - **Mitigation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation (k=5), early stopping
   - **Recommendation:** Split data 80/20 train/test, monitor validation RMSE

3. **Communication Overhead Not Modeled**
   - **Issue:** IoT devices consume 2-3% additional power
   - **Mitigation:** Add constant overhead to energy calculations
   - **Impact:** Reduces net savings by ~2-3 percentage points

4. **Weather Data Simplified**
   - **Issue:** Weather modeled as discrete categories (0/1/2)
   - **Mitigation:** Integrate real weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, NOAA)
   - **Enhancement:** Add fog index, humidity, precipitation intensity

5. **Safety Regulations**
   - **Issue:** Real deployments have stricter minimum brightness (20-30%)
   - **Mitigation:** Configurable minBrightness parameter
   - **Impact:** Higher minimums reduce savings by 5-10%
